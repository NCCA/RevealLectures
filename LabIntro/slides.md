# Studios
- each year group has a studio (CAA / CVA share)
- BSc SDAGE has new STEM lab in the Fusion building
	- and W110 as an independent study space

--

# Hardware

- Each studio has a number of machines
- all should be the same hardware spce 
	- usually i7 Hex Core 16 / 32 Gb Ram and 500Gb SSD)

--

# Software

- Most lab machines have dual boot Linux / Windows
	- Linux is widely used in industry and most animation software is supported
- Some software is Windows only (Photoshop / Z Brush) hence the need for dual boot

# Versions

- Can I have Maya Version 2019.35 version 2.1
- short answer  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
	- No <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- long answer <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
	- Maya is more like an "operating system" for CGI, we use many plugins and tools <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
	- These need testing and lots of preperation so uptake of latest versions is slow <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
- This is true of all software installed <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

# Updates / Fixes
- We have a twice yearly update cycle for software
	- Once at the Christmas break
	- Once at the Easter break
- These will usually be maintanace updates, however extra software may be requested
- This has to go via me and may not be approved, depending upon license / compatability.

# Reporting Problems

- If something doesn't work it needs to be reported
- If we don't know we can't evaluate or fix it.
- Hardware problems should be reported to IT services
- Software problems should initially be reported to the lecturing staff or demonstrators to see if the problem is repeatable
