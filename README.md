# The Source Code for my lectures

This repository will contain the source code for my online lectures which use a number of different java script projects, but mainly [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/).

This is really just an upload for me to store and version control my work and not really to be viewed by students unless they want to see how I do it, all the external java script libs will not be stored and only the lecture note sources will be here.

To see the lectures check out my website (work in progress on updating to use reveal at present).
